# LU Factorization Algorithm

This Matlab algorithm factorizes a square matrix, A, into P, A, L, and U where PA=LU.

The input is the square matrix A

The output is the pivot matrix P, the original matrix A, the lower matrix L, and the upper matrix U

It's limitations are that the lower matrix L is not pivoted accurately and the P matrix is calculated slightly off because of that. 
The A and U matrix should be fine though.
